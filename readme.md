# AnnexBios Headquarters API

Welcome to the AnnexBios Headquarters API repository! This project serves as the core backend system for all our movie theater establishments, providing a centralized API for data management and communication between branches. We also host a home page that provides general information.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the main folders and files in this repository:

- **dummy_data/**: This folder contains JSON files with dummy data used for testing and development purposes. The structure of these files mimics the actual data used in production.
  
- **documents/**: In this folder, you'll find the API User Guide, which provides comprehensive documentation on how to use the AnnexBios API, including available endpoints and request/response formats.

## API User Guide

For detailed information on how to interact with the API, refer to the [API User Guide](documents/Hoofdkantoor API Guide.docx) located in the `documents/` folder.
